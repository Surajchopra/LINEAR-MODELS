SESSION 11: Linear Models 
Assignment 1 
 
1. Use the link given below and locate the bank marketing dataset. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00222/ 
Perform the below operations: 

a. Create a visual for representing missing values in the dataset. 
b. Show a distribution of clients based on a job.
c. Check whether is there any relation between Job and Marital Status? 
d. Check whether is there any association between Job and Education?


Answer:

library(readr) 
bank_full <- read_delim("bank-full.csv", ";", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)

or 
we can also use below function to open the dataset in data frame structure

bank_full <- read.csv(file.choose(), header = TRUE, sep = ";")
bank_full

a:Create a visual for representing missing values in the dataset. 

if(length(which(is.na(bank_full$age)==TRUE)>0))
{
  print("Missing Value found in the specified column")
}
else
  print("All okay: No Missing Value found in the specified column")

Output:
[1] "All okay: No Missing Value found in the specified column"

head(bank_full)
str(bank_full) 

summary(bank_full) 				## Provides basic statistical information of each variable
is.na(bank_full) 				## Displays True for a missing value

missmap(bank_full,main="Missing Data - Bank ", col=c("red","grey"),legend=FALSE)

b. Show a distribution of clients based on a job.

Answer:

barplot(table(bank_full$job),col="red",main="JOB")

barplot(table(bank_full$marital),col="green",main="Marital")

barplot(table(bank_full$education),col="red",main="Education")

par(oma=c(2,0,0,0)) #so labels are not cut off
barplot(table(bank_full$job),ylab = "Frequency", main = "bank_full$job", border="black", col="grey",las=2)

#Histogram for job,marital and education - three categorical variables

par(oma=c(2,0,0,0)) #so labels are not cut off
barplot(table(bank_full$job),ylab = "Frequency", main = "bank_full$job", border="yellow", col="violet",las=2)

par(oma=c(2,0,0,0)) #so labels are not cut off
barplot(table(bank_full$marital),ylab = "Frequency", main = "bank_full$marital", border="green", col="yellow",las=2)

par(oma=c(2,0,0,0)) #so labels are not cut off
barplot(table(bank_full$education),ylab = "Frequency", main = "bank_full$education", border="red", col="blue",las=2)

c. Check whether is there any relation between Job and Marital Status? 

Answer:

chisq.test <- with(bank_full, chisq.test( job, marital))

OutPut:
	Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  job and marital
X-squared = 3837.6, df = 22, p-value < 2.2e-16
with(bank_full, table( job, marital))

Output:
               marital
job             divorced married single

d. Check whether is there any association between Job and Education?

Answer:
with(bank_full, chisq.test(job,education))

Output:
	Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  job and education
X-squared = 28483, df = 33, p-value < 2.2e-16


with(bank_full, table( job, education))

Output:
